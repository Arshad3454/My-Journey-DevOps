-Kubernetes is a container orchistration platform.
- containers are short life 

-api server :take all request from external world.
-scheduler :its schedule the works.
-ETCD : store all information 
-controller managements :

why kubernetes used
    1-kubernetus is a cluster
    2- offer Auto scaling
    3- offer Auto Healing :monitors the health state of the cluster and automatically repairs Kubernetes
    4- enterprise level behaviour

-Kubectl : its a command line interface to run the kubernetes commands
    kubectl create -f pod.yml :create the pod
    kubectl get pods 
    kubectl describe pod <podname>
    kubectl logs <podname>
    kubectl



Minikube :its a command line tool that will allow to create kubernets cluster


    minikube start:
    kubectl get nodes:

example of container running a imagek
-vi pod.yaml

  {
    apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  }


 kubectl create -f pod.yml :craete the pods

 kubectl get pods  :to see created pods
 kubectl get pods -o wide  :see entire details of pods


-login to kubernets cluster: minikube ssh
                            ssh 172.267.87.1

- kubectl logs nginx  :see the logs of pods
-kubectl delete pod nginx :delete the pods
-kubectl describe pods : get the all information about the pod
  
  kubectl get all     -will get all resources details.

container:
pod : somewhere stmler to container , Dont have auto healing and scsling ability.
deployment:using pods only , but its are inside deployment sets, it will create replicas set and help for auto scaling and auto healing.

    -Deployment use to manages a template of pods and uses replica sets, whereas ReplicaSet are only use to manages the expected number of replicas.

Kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    it will create a deployment -> kubectl get deployment
    deployment will create a replica set for us -> kubectl get rs 
    replica set will create pods for us ->kubectl get pods

    Deploy -->replica set --> pods

kubextl get all
kubectl get pods -w  --> to monitor the pods activity 
    

kubernets services:  enthinaan (auto healing ollath kond (new pods up aavumbol) ,ip address change avum, so traffic mange cheyyan)
        - load balancing :
        - service discovery : pods will identify using label and selectors
        - expose to external world 
    
    -load balencer type  :Any body can access   eg :Amazon.com
    -Node port type mode: only can access who have access to worker Node eg: (people who have in office)
    - cluster ip mode :only can access who have access to kubernets cluster network eg :devops enginner ,aws engineer


Interview question 
1- what is the diffrence between docker and kubernstus
Ans: docker is a container platform , K8 is container orchstation  enviournment that offers capabilities like autohealing, auto scaling,
     clusturing and enterprise level support like loadbalencing.
     
2- what are the main components of K8 architecture
Ans : 1- control plane:APi server, sheduler, control manager, ETCD 
           -api server :take all request from external world.
            -scheduler :its schedule the works.
            -ETCD : store all information 
            -controller managements :
      2- Data plane :kubelet-managing the pod , kube-proxy- networking components , contaioner runtime-


3-diffrence b/w k8 and docker swarm.
    k8 is better suited for large and middle orgainaisation, k8 is offers more scalablity.k8 huge 3rd party support.

4- diffrence b//w docker container and k8 pods 
    k8 pods is a run time specification of a container

5- what is a namespace in k8
    namespace is a logical isolation of resources, network,policies, rbac and everything.

6- what is the role of kube-proxy
    kube-proxy basically about configuring the networking eules in each of the node.

7- what are the diffrent services in K8
         - load balancing :
        - service discovery : pods will identify using label and selectors
        - expose to external world

8- diffrence b/w load balencer and NodePort service

9- what is the role of kubelet
    kubelet manage the containers that are sheduled to run on that node.it ensure that containers are running healhy, and that the resourcesthey need are available.

10- Day to Day activites in K8
    we mange k8 cluster our organaisation.we ensure applications are deployed on k8 cluster.and ensure there is no issue with application 
    and we setup motiotoring on k8 cluster .....
